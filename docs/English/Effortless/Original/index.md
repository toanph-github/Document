## Day of the Dead

I arrive in Guatemala on The Day of the Dead, November 1st. I’m curious about this holiday, so I go
to the cemetery to see what’s happening. What I find is quite interesting. 

The atmosphere is like a party. There are people everywhere. Families are sitting around the
graves of their dead ancestors. They clean the graves and add fresh flowers. I walk through the
cemetery and admire the beauty of all the colorful flowers. 

There is also color in the sky, because many kids are flying kites. Some families are having a picnic
next to the graves. They eat, drink, and chat together. People laugh and smile. 

In the Unites States, cemeteries are always somber. We certainly never have festivals or parties
next to graves. We don’t laugh or play music or fly kites in cemeteries either. 

I find that I prefer the Guatemalan approach. I like the way they remember and celebrate those
who have passed away. I like that they acknowledge death, instead of denying it the way
Americans do. I like that there is life, as well as death, in their cemeteries. 

Guatemalans call it “The Day of the Dead”, but it is also a day to appreciate life.

## A Kiss

Carlos buys a new car. It’s a very expensive car. It’s a huge, blue, fast car. While driving down the treet, Carlos sees a girl on a bicycle.

She has long blond hair and is beautiful.

He yells to her, “What’s up?“

She ignores him.

He yells, “How’s it going?“

She keeps going and ignores him.

He yells, “Hey, why won’t you talk to me? I want to go to dinner with you. I’ll take you to an expensive restaurant.”

The girl turns, gets off the bike, and looks at him. She says, “I don’t want to go to dinner. But if you give me your car, I will give you a sur-prise.”

## Bubba’s Food

Sara Smith, who lives in San Francisco, went shopping for cat food. 

Sara is 30, and lives at 3037 Market St. She has lived there since 1990. Sara is married. She is
married to a man named John. She has been married for 7 years.

They have two children, and one very big cat. Their son Bob is five years old and their daughter
Nancy is three. Their cat, Bubba, is 2 years old. Bubba is huge. He weighs 258 pounds (117
kilos)!

At 9am, Sara got into her car and drove to the pet store. She bought 68 bags of cat food for $10
each plus tax. The regular price was $15, so she got a good deal. The total was $680. She paid
by credit card. 

On her way home, Sara stopped at a convenience store to buy milk. Bubba loves milk. The milk
was $3.00 for one gallon, and Sara bought 30 gallons. She paid $100 and got $10 back in
change.

Sara got home at 11 a.m. Bubba was waiting at the door. He was very hungry. 

## Changed

NO AFFECTION ANYMORE

DEAR ABBY: 

My husband of 39 years no longer hugs me or shows me any affection. I have seen him through
cancer and diabetes. We have four grown children, and we have been seeing a therapist for a year
and a half. He is kind, generous and friendly, but there are no compliments or any of the flirtatious
banter we used to enjoy.

He swears he's not having an affair, and he doesn't know why he has changed. Perhaps you do?

## Drag

HIGH PRICE OF MOM'S HELP IS DRAG ON FAMILY BUSINESS

DEAR ABBY: 

Twenty years ago, my sister and I bought a business from our mother. We all love and respect one
another and get along well. We will be finished paying off the business in two years

Our problem: Mom, who is now 77, still draws a salary from us above and beyond the payment for
the business. Her workload has lessened greatly, as it should. She could do all of her work in one
day and lessen the burden of her salary. However, she says she'd "go crazy" if she retired. We
don't want that. She could still come in as often as she wants and do her personal paperwork, banking, letter-writing, reading, etc. These are all things she does at "work" -- on the clock.

If we try to discuss this, Mom gets hurt and says, "Just let me know when I'm not worth the money."
We don't want to do that. We would hope she would see the fairness of this and suggest it herself.

Business expenses are going through the roof, and there are updates we should make, but we
can't do it as long as we are paying Mom at the level we are, on top of the money for the buy-out.

## Intimacy

DEAR ABBY: 

My husband, "James," and I have been married only three years. We are both in our 20s.
Everything is really great between us -- except our sex life. As far as he is concerned that's fine,
too, but I am not satisfied. It may seem odd to hear the female wants to have sex more frequently
than a young and healthy male, but that's the case in our relationship.

Abby, I work with the public and I get frequent remarks about what a beautiful woman I am. This
makes it hard for me to believe that I don't attract him at all. I have expressed many times that I
wish we were more intimate. I have even expressed it to him in more than one letter, hoping to
reach him.

I am at a total loss as to how to make him realize how important this is to me. Is there something
wrong with my body? I just don't know who to turn to for advice on this subject. Please help me.

## Secret Love

WOMAN HESITATES TO REVEAL SECRET LOVE FOR COLLEAGUE

DEAR ABBY: 

I am a single woman in my early 30s who has never been married. I recently fell in love with a wonderful man with whom I spend a great deal of time. He is unaware of the intensity of my feelings,
and I'm afraid of telling him out of fear of rejection.

There are a couple of additional concerns: He is 15 years my senior and a medical doctor. I am a
social worker in a lower economic class. In addition, we are of different religions, but we have similar spiritual beliefs and values. He is also my co-worker.

I am very interested in pursuing a deeper relationship with this man, but would like to hear your
advice first. Thank you for your thoughts on this.

## Bad Choices

Publish Date: April 6, 2007

Dear Dr. Tracy,

I am a 33 year old divorced woman with four kids. I was married for 12 years and I have been divorced for
approximately 3 years. I met my new boyfriend during my divorce. We hit it off and have been together ever
since. He is a 44 year old divorced man. When I met him he had been divorced for 2 years. Well, I met his exwife and she seemed to be an okay person. What I found out 3 months into my relationship with him was that
he was fooling around with his ex-wife again-- who also at this time had a boyfriend of her own. I figured
that since I did not have a committed relationship with him, I had no place to say anything. The problem is
it continued further into our relationship, up to the point when I found out I was pregnant. At the same time I
found out that he and his ex-wife planned to go to his family reunion together. Of course before all of this, I
drove by his house one night and saw her car parked outside his home. The excuse I got after all of this was
that they were considering getting back together. I thought it was very funny that as soon as she met me, she
found interest in him again.

I guess my issue is the fact that now I am still in this relationship. I have brought a child into this nonsense
and I hate the fact that he keeps in contact with her. My boyfriend has taken responsibility for her son from a
previous relationship. His excuse for having so much contact with his ex-wife is because of that boy. I know
this is not true but I have no real proof otherwise. I have also dealt with him taking women to hotels and my
gut tells me it was her, but he promises it was not her.

I have tried to get over all the cheating. I know that she is very close to his family and I also know that his
family does not like me because I stand up for myself. I guess the bottom line is knowing how much contact
his ex-wife has with him and the fact that he knows I can’t stand her. Am I in a weird relationship with a man
that wants to have his cake and eat it too? Or am I being paranoid and need to trust him when he says he
does not want her. I have never had so much animosity towards two people in my life. I do love this man, but
I feel like I have put myself back in an unhealthy relationship with a man that is trying to lie to me.

To be totally honest, now that I have his child I even hate the fact that he helps her son. She never has to ask
for anything regarding that boy, but I have to constantly remind him when our son needs something. He does it
for the other boy without thinking, but my son is a second thought even when I have said, “Look at your son.
He is in dire need”. I was married to a cheating man and hooked up with another cheating man. I wonder if
it’s just my bad choices in men. 

## Double Standard

Publish Date: April 8, 2007

FAMILY IS UNEASY WHEN ONE SISTER DATES OTHER'S EX-LOVER

DEAR ABBY: 

My sister, "Jane," and I are both in our mid-50s. Jane has had numerous affairs over the past several years
after her third divorce, and was involved in an "intimate relationship" with a terrific man, "Will," that lasted
about three months. Jane broke up with Will several months after she decided he wasn't what she was looking
for, and she's presently engaged to be married to a very nice man ("Sam") and seems very happy.

I dated Will several times before he and Jane became involved. We weren't intimate at that time, and we started seeing each other again over the last month. This time we have fallen in love.

My problem is Jane is upset that Will and I are together and says I have "betrayed" her. She is worried about
having her former and current lovers present at family gatherings, and our parents are also concerned. They say
it's "just weird." The fact that my sister was intimate with Will doesn't bother me or Will, but it sure bothers
them.

Abby, I have always been the "good girl" in the family and bowed to their pressure, but my relationship with
Will is more than I could have ever imagined, and I don't want to give up my future happiness just to make my
sister and my parents more comfortable. My adult children have all met and approve of Will and our relationship, but Jane and my parents won't budge. Any suggestions? 

-- WANTS WILL IN WALLA WALLA, WASH.

DEAR WANTS WILL: Perhaps it's time to stop being the "good girl," begin acting like a woman who knows
what she wants, and confront the double standard in your family. If your sister was "sophisticated" enough to
have serial affairs, and your parents have been so worldly they have turned a blind eye to it, then they should
all be adult enough to realize that you are entitled to your happiness, too.

Although this may make for some awkward first few family gatherings, as grown-ups, everyone should be able
to get past it. But if they can't, you are going to have to decide whether you want this man, or to be a peoplepleaser for the rest of your life.

## Greek Family

WOMAN WILL NEVER BE GREEK ENOUGH FOR HUSBAND'S FAMILY

DEAR ABBY: 

I married a Greek man whose family never accepted me. Being young and naive, I tried everything to fit in,
converting from Catholicism to the Greek Orthodox faith, attending all family functions, including them in
our lives. It was never enough.

My husband and I traveled to Crete with his family to visit his relatives there, and some extended family
members refused to share the dinner table with me because I was not Greek. One of those family members
was a priest!

Our daughter, "Athena," was born four years later. What broke the camel's back for me was a Christmas dinner when she was 6. My father-in-law gave cards with $100 to all the grandchildren of Greek heritage. Athena
received nothing and cried for hours wanting to know why her grandfather didn't love her. My husband just
tried to stay neutral.

Abby, how far should someone have to go to fit in with their husband’s family?
