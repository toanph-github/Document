## A Kiss

Carlos buys a new car. It’s a very expensive car. It’s a huge, blue, fast car. While driving down the treet, Carlos sees a girl on a bicycle.

She has long blond hair and is beautiful.

He yells to her, “What’s up?“

She ignores him.

He yells, “How’s it going?“

She keeps going and ignores him.

He yells, “Hey, why won’t you talk to me? I want to go to dinner with you. I’ll take you to an expensive restaurant.”

The girl turns, gets off the bike, and looks at him. She says, “I don’t want to go to dinner. But if you give me your car, I will give you a sur-prise.”
