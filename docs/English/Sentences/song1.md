## Take Me to Your Heart

lyrics | Translate
------------ | -------------
Hiding from the rain and snow. | Tránh những hại mưa và tuyết
Trying to forget but I won't let go. | Cố gắng quyên nhưng tôi sẽ không buông
Looking at a crowded street. | Nhìn vào một con đường đông đúc
Listening to my own heart beat. | Lắng nghe nhịp đập của tim tôi
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
So many people all around the world. | Rất là nhiều người trên khắp thế giới
Tell me where do I find someone like you girl. | Nói với tối ở đâu đó tôi tìm được một người giống cô gái đó
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
Take me to your heart take me to your soul. | Mang tôi đến trái tim bạn, mang tôi tới tâm hồn bạn
Give me your hand before I'm old.| Đưa tay cho tối trước khi tôi già
Show me what love is - haven't got a clue. | Cho tôi biết tình yêu là gì - Điều tôi chưa biết
Show me that wonders can be true. | Cho tôi thấy rằng điều kỳ diệu là sự thực
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
They say nothing lasts forever. | Họ nói không có gì là mãi mãi
We're only here today. | Chỉ có chúng ta ở đây hôm nay
Love is now or never. | Tình yêu là bây giờ hoặc không bây giờ
Bring me far away. | Mang tôi đến nơi thật xa
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
Take me to your heart take me to your soul. | Mang tôi đến trái tim bạn, mang tôi tới tâm hồn bạn
Give me your hand and hold me. | Đưa tay bạn cho tôi và giữ lấy tôi
Show me what love is - be my guiding star. | Cho tôi biết tình yêu là gì - giống như vì sao chỉ đường cho tôi
It's easy take me to your heart. | Nó thật dễ để đưa tôi đến trái tim bạn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
Standing on a mountain high. | Đứng trên những ngọn núi cao
Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky. | Nhìn mặt trăng qua bầu trời trong xanh
I should go and see some friends. | Tôi nên đi gặp một vài người bạn
But they don't really comprehend. | Nhưng họ không thật sự hiểu
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
Don't need too much talking without saying anything. | Đừng nói quá nhiều mà không nói gì
All I need is someone who makes me want to sing. | Tất cả những gì tôi cần là một người khiến tôi muốn hát

## My Heart Will Go On

lyrics | Translate
------------ | -------------
Every night in my dreams | Hằng đêm trong những giấc mơ của tôi
I see you, I feel you | Tôi nhìn thấy, cảm nhận thấy bạn
That is how I know you go on | Đó là cách tôi biết bạn vẫn tiếp tục
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
Far across the distance | Khoảng cách thật xa
And spaces between us | và không gian giữa hai chúng ta
You have come to show you go on | Bạn đã đến để cho thấy rằng bạn vẫn tiếp tục
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
Near, far, wherever you are | Gần, xa, Dừ bạn ở đâu
I believe that the heart does go on | Tôi tin rằng trái tim vẫn sẽ tiếp tục
Once more you open the door | Một lần nữa bạn mở cửa
And you're here in my heart | Và bạn ở đây trong trái tim tối
And my heart will go on and on | Và trái tim tôi vẫn sẽ tiếp tục
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
Love can touch us one time | Tình yêu có thể chạm đến chúng ta một lần
And last for a lifetime | Và kéo dài suốt đời
And never let go 'til we're gone | Và đừng bao giờ buông cho tới khi chúng ta ra đi
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
Love was when I loved you | Tình yêu là khi tôi yêu bạn
One true time I'd hold to | Khoảng thời gian thật sự mà tôi nắm giữa
In my life we'll always go on | Trong cuộc sống của tối, chúng tối sẽ luôn tiếp tục
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
You're here, there's nothing I fear | Bạn đang ở dây, không có gì làm tôi sợ
And I know that my heart will go on | Và tôi biết trái tim tôi vẫn tiếp tục
We'll stay forever this way | Chúng tôi đứng mãi trên con đường này
You are safe in my heart and | Bạn an toàn trong trái tim tôi và
My heart will go on and on | Và trái tim tôi vẫn sẽ tiếp tục

It's been a long day without you my friend. | 
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again. |
We've come a long way from where we began. |
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again. |
When I see you again. |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
Damn, who knew all the planes we flew. | 
Good things we've been through. |
That I'll be standing right here. |
Talking to you about another path. |
I Know we loved to hit the road and laugh. |
But something told me that it wouldn't last. |
Had to switch up look at things different see the bigger picture. |
Those were the days hard work forever pays now I see you in a better place. |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?. |
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side.|
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride.|
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |

When I see you again.|
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
First you both go out your way.|
And the vibe is feeling strong and what's.|
Small turn to a friendship, a friendship.|
Turn into a bond and that bond will never.|
Be broken and the love will never get lost.|
And when brotherhood come first then the line.|
Will never be crossed established it on our own.|
When that line had to be drawn and that line is what.|
We reach so remember me when I'm gone.|
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?.|

So let the light guide your way hold every memory.|
As you go and every road you take will always lead you home.|

## Attention

```text
Oh-oh, ooh
You've been runnin' round, runnin' round, runnin' round throwin' that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd call you up
You've been going round, going round, going round every party in L.A.
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd be at one, oh

I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine, oh
And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect?
But you're not coming home with me tonight

You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you

you've been runnin' round, runnin' round, runnin' round throwing that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd call you up
Baby, now that we're, now that we're, now that we're right here standing face-to-face
You already know, already know, already know that you won, oh

I know that dress is karma (dress is karma), perfume regret
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine (you got me thinking 'bout when you were mine)
And now I'm all up on ya (all up on ya), what you expect? (oh baby)
But you're not coming home with me tonight (oh no)

You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you, oh

What are you doin' to me, what are you doin', huh?
(What are you doin'?)
What are you doin' to me, what are you doin', huh?
(What are you doin'?)
What are you doin' to me, what are you doin', huh?
(What are you doin'?)
What are you doin' to me, what are you doin', huh?

I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine
And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect?
But you're not coming home with me tonight

You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you (over you)

What are you doin' to me? (hey) what are you doin', huh? (what are you doin', what?)
(What are you doin', to me? What are you doin', huh?)
(What are you doin', to me? What are you doin', huh?)
(What are you doin' to me, what are you doin', huh?)

## Skyfall

&nbsp; | &nbsp;
------------ | -------------
This is the end |
Hold your breath and count to ten |
Feel the earth move and then |
Hear my heart burst again |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
For this is the end |
I've drowned and dreamt this moment |
So overdue I owe them |
Swept away, I'm stolen |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
Let the sky fall |
When it crumbles |
We will stand tall |
Face it all together
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
Let the sky fall |
When it crumbles |
We will stand tall |
Face it all together |
At skyfall |
At skyfall |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
Skyfall is where we start |
A thousand miles and poles apart |
Where worlds collide and days are dark |
You may have my number, you can take my name |
But you'll never have my heart |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
Let the sky fall |
When it crumbles |
We will stand tall |
Face it all together |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
Let the sky fall |
When it crumbles |
We will stand tall |
Face it all together |
At skyfall |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
Where you go I go |
What you see I see |
I know… |
